Bubble Sort Experiment
By: Sam Schmitz
This file contains some of the information about how the Bubble sort expirement went

Here is a sample of when the program is run:
This program compares the speeds of the Bubble Sort Algorithm and an Expiremental one
Enter the test list size: 5000
Enter the number of trials: 3

Original Bubble Sort:
trial 1: 4
trial 2: 5
trial 3: 3
total: 13.161434888839722

average: 4.387144962946574

Experimental Bubble Sort:
trial 1: 2
trial 2: 2
trial 3: 2
total: 8.451375722885132

average: 2.8171252409617105

The Expiremental Bubble Sort was Faster

As I have tested with large list sizes(>2000) the experimental version is Faster
At test smaller test sizes the results are less noticeable and can potentially swing either way.
